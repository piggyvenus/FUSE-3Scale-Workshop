JBDS will ask, if you want to change to Fuse perspective, click *Yes*.

=== Create a development property file

Under *src/main/resources* duplicate *application.properties* and with name [aqua]*application-dev.properties*, we are going to use this as the setting during our development time.
You can make a copy by selecting the file and push *Ctrl+C* and *Ctrl+V*. You will be prompted to change the name.

Open the newly created file (*application-dev.properties*) by double clicking on the file name in the *Project Explorer* window and
append the following datasource configuration to the end of the file.

```
#tomcat ports
server.port=9080
#Database configuration
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:mydb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.username = sa
spring.datasource.password =
spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.platform = h2
```

[red]*NOTE:* we are using H2 in memory database for testing. And thanks to autowiring in SpringBoot, it is now automatically loaded and wired as the default datasource to the Camel context.

=== Create a SQL table

Create a new file under *src/main/resources* by right clicking on the folder itself in the project explorer panel, then select **New** -> **Others** from the menu

Add the following SQL to **schema.sql**

```
CREATE TABLE customerdemo (
	customerID varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	vipStatus varchar(10) NOT NULL ,
	balance integer NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO customerdemo (customerID,vipStatus,balance) VALUES ('A01','Diamond',1000);
INSERT INTO customerdemo (customerID,vipStatus,balance) VALUES ('A02','Gold',500);

=== Add components to our Route

We will use *Timer* component to kick start our Route for now, drag the **TIMER** component from the *Components* palette on the right, and drag it to the Route.

Under *Properties*-> *Advance* tab -> *Consumer*  tab, set **Repeat Count** to **1**

and in *Common* tab set **Data Source** to [aqua]**dataSource**
